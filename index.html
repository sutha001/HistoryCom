            Cuneiform is a system of writing first developed by the 
            <br>ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia c. 3500-3000 BCE. It is 
            <br>considered the most significant among the many cultural

            <br>of the Sumerian city of Uruk which advanced the writing of

            The abacus also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool 
            <br>that was in use in the ancient Near East, Europe, China, and 
            <br>Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written Arabic 
            <br>numeral system.The exact origin of the abacus is still 
            <br>unknown. The abacus essentially consists of a number of rows 
            <br>of movable beads or other objects, which represent digits. One 
            <br>of two numbers is set up, and the beads are manipulated to 
            <br>implement an operation involving a second number (e.g., 
            <br>addition), or rarely a square or cubic root.

            <br>calculation of products and quotients of numbers. The method 
            <br>was based on lattice multiplication, and also called 
            <br>'rabdology', a word invented by Napier. Napier published his 
            <br>version in 1617 in Rabdologiæ, printed in Edinburgh, 
            <br>dedicated to his patron Alexander Seton.

            Pascal's calculatoris a mechanical calculator invented by Blaise 
            <br>Pascal in the mid 17th century. Pascal was led to develop a 
            <br>calculator by the laborious arithmetical calculations required 
            <br>by his father's work as the supervisor of taxes in Rouen. 
            <br>He designed the machine to add and subtract two numbers 
            <br>directly and to perform multiplication and division through 
            <br>repeated addition or subtraction.

            <br>operating mechanism, Staffelwalze, meaning "stepped drum". It 
            <br>was the first calculator that could perform all four

        <p class="texx5">
            A difference engine, first created by Charles Babbage, is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions. Its name is derived from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial co-efficients. Most mathematical functions commonly used by engineers, scientists and navigators, including logarithmic and trigonometric functions, can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful tables of numbers.
